# Optical-Character-Recognition
A program written purely in D using the arsd library that is able to do OCR on a text image. The text must be in black color, the background doesn't matter so much. The letters must be in a size of at least 22 x 22 pixels in order for it to read properly. If they are smaller than that then it may not work well. If you wish to read the source code and understand it then you should start by reading the file training.d and then read the file identifying.d and then read the file reading.d and then read the file generating.d and then read the file source.d. If you want to test it then download the arsd library and compile the file source.d after downloading all of the dependencies and then press Enter and watch it reading the text images. It was made for the Linux environment. It may or may not work well on Windows.
